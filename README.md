tdgenie - (Test data genie)
=======
A micro-library that provides capabilities for generating different types of test data. 


Features:

    * Very lightweight - no additional dependencies required
    * Respectable range of options & modability
    * Uses the "Fluent interface" approach - code is easy to read and write
  

Perfect for testing Java webapps &amp; various databases. The generated data is returned as Java collections stored in RAM: 
no built-in method for writing to disk (e.g. txt, csv) is currently provided. Some basic usage examples can be found in the
"TestMain" class (located in the "src" folder, package "ee.nemp.tdgenie")

PS. This software is a work in progress - it may contain major bugs & other notable shortcomings.
