tdgenie - (Test data genie)
=======
A micro-library that provides capabilities for generating different types of test data. 


Features:
* Very lightweight - no additional dependencies required
* Respectable range of options & modability
* Uses the _Fluent interface_ approach - code is easy to read and write
  

Perfect for testing Java webapps &amp; various databases. The generated data is returned as Java collections stored in RAM: 
no built-in method for writing to disk (e.g. txt, csv) is currently provided. Some basic usage examples can be found in the
"**_TestMain_**" class (located in the "**_src_**" folder, package "**_ee.nemp.tdgenie_**")

PS. This software is a work in progress - it may contain major bugs & other notable shortcomings.
