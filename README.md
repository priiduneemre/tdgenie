tdgenie - (Test data genie)
=======
A micro-library that provides capabilities for generating different types of test data. 


Features:
* Very lightweight - no additional dependencies required
* Reasonable range of options & modability
* Utilizes the _Fluent interface_ approach - code is easy to read and write
  

Perfect for testing Java webapps &amp; various databases. The generated data is returned as Java collections stored in RAM: 
no built-in method for writing to disk (e.g. txt, csv) is currently provided. 

Basic usage examples can be found in the **_TestMain_** class (located in the **_src_** folder, package 
**_ee.nemp.tdgenie_**). More complete, commented examples coming soon.





_P.S. This software is a work in progress - it may contain unwanted "features" & other notable shortcomings._
